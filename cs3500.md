## give three different examples from the real world which demonstrate that there is still a software crisis

	>杀毒软件对日益增长的病毒集团的威胁，就是典型的软件危机

	>再来几个案例
	>回答
	>知道浏览器兼容吧，浏览器的供应商愈来愈多，标准也在不停的变化，需要支持的技术也愈来愈多，基于BS开发的软件危机也在时刻的累积。国内现在IE6的应用还很多，当用户开始转移到IE9或其他主流的标准浏览器上后，那样老式的Web系统就要被迫重新迎合新的标准，这样的危机就是很现实的软件危机了。原来的代码或模式已经不再适应将来的或现在的模式了

	>兄弟们，“免费的午餐已经结束了”。
	>摩尔定律在串行机器上宣告失效，多核时代正式来临！

	>这个时候怎样在多核平台上仍然能保持性能的持续增长就成为了这一次软件危机的核心。并行编程给我们带来了许许多多新的技术难题，现阶段想要高效的利用这些多核平台以获得更好的性能，就必须对计算机的硬件有较深入的理解，而广大程序员却更喜欢能有一些更加便利的编程模型（也许是一门新的语言、也许是新的编程模型）来简单高效地进行并行编程。我们正处在这次危机的开端，前路满是荆棘。但是只要有问题，就会有机会。多核时代，你们的机会在哪里呢？

## what are legacy systems and why do they exist

	A legacy system is an old method, technology, computer system, or application program.

	The decision to keep an old system may be influenced by economic reasons such as return on investment challenges or vendor lock-in, the inherent challenges of change management, or a variety of other reasons other than functionality.

	Organizations can have compelling reasons for keeping a legacy system, such as:
	* The system works satisfactorily, and the owner sees no reason for changing it.
	* The costs of redesigning or replacing the system are prohibitive because it is large, monolithic, and/or complex.
	* Retraining on a new system would be costly in lost time and money, compared to the anticipated appreciable benefits of replacing it (which may be zero).
	* The system requires near-constant availability, so it cannot be taken out of service, and the cost of designing a new system with a similar availability level is high. Examples include systems to handle customers' accounts in banks, computer reservation systems, air traffic control, energy distribution (power grids), nuclear power plants, military defense installations, and systems such as the TOPS database.
	* The way that the system works is not well understood. Such a situation can occur when the designers of the system have left the organization, and the system has either not been fully documented or documentation has been lost.
	* The user expects that the system can easily be replaced when this becomes necessary.

	Legacy Systems (1)
	Legacy systems are software (and sometimes hardware) systems that have been developed sometime in the past using older or obsolete technology (e.g. COBOL).
	 Often serve business-critical functions
	 Often too risky to replace them
	 Often were developed to run on centralised mainframe machines and then modified (but not re-designed) to run on distributed PC networks   very significant source of errors

	Legacy Systems (2)
	Staff & budget shortages mean that legacy software persists in organisations rather than being replaced – obviously progress IS being made in eliminating old obsolete systems
	Legacy systems require that obsolete skills be maintained (e.g. there is still a need for COBOL and DIBOL programmers although it is unlikely that much new software has been written in these languages for the last 20 years or more.
	Legacy systems are extremely expensive to maintain because 
	    		(a) They were usually not built with modification in mind
	    		(b) Written in 2 & 3 GL code which has low productivity

## what are the components of an information system?what role does communication and control have in ensuring that systems remain stable

	An Information System (IS) consists of five basic resources,[53] namely:
	Personnel, which consists of IT specialists (such as a Database Administrator or Network Engineer) and end-users (such as Data Capture Clerks)
	Hardware, which consists of all the physical aspects of an information system, ranging from peripherals to computer parts and servers
	Software, which consists of System Software, Application Software and Utility Software
	Networks, which consists of communication media and network support
	Data, which consists of all the knowledge and databases in the IS

## draw the actual and idealised life-expectancy curves for software. explain precisely the reasons for ther shape of the actual curve.

## waterfall model  


	### Advantages of waterfall model:

	- Simple and easy to understand and use.
	- Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model – each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.
	- Phases are processed and completed one at a time.
	- Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.
	 
	### Disadvantages of waterfall model:

	- Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage.
	- No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
	- High amounts of risk and uncertainty.
	- Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.
	- Poor model for long and ongoing projects.
	- Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing.

## List four basic recommendations made by the Agile Alliance in 2001.

	- Individuals and interactions between them have  priority over processes and tools
	- Working software takes precedence over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration more important than contract negotiation
	- Ability to respond to change more important than sticking blindly to a plan

## differences between prototyping and exploratory programming. example of them.

	Prototyping:
	exploratory:Smalltalk


## explain what is meant by the term "common coupling" .should software systems display common coupling ?

	coupling or dependency is the degree to which each program module relies on each one of the other modules.
	Common coupling (also known as Global coupling) is when two modules share the same global data (e.g., a global variable).
	Changing the shared resource implies changing all the modules using it.

## what one kind of cohesion would you most want to avoid during program design?reason?

	Coincidental cohesion.
	Coincidental cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped arbitrarily; the only relationship between the parts is that they have been grouped together (e.g. a “Utilities” class).

## Name any two key principles to bear in mind before beginning the design of a user interface.
	
	clear test objectives, enhanced usability test plan
	what why when who how

## Cyclomatic complexity
	
	V(G) = Number of closed loops + 1 
	V(G) = E- N + 2
	V(G): Cyclomatic complexity
	E: the number of flow graph edges
	N: the number of flow graph nodes
